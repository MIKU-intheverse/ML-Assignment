<h1>ML-Assignment</h1>

<h2>Lab 1 â€“ Linear Regression from Scratch</h2>

Implemented linear regression using NumPy (no scikit-learn) on two datasets: `Advertising.csv` and `Housing.csv`, including EDA, model training, and evaluation.

<h2>Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Lab</h2>

This lab assignment focuses on data preprocessing techniques including outlier removal, feature scaling (Min-Max & Standard), and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
It prepares a cleaned and normalized dataset for machine learning model training and evaluation.
